## Findings from logs

### F-001 — No `pubspec.lock` in repo (N-002)

Each job runs `flutter pub get` and reports **Changed 85–102 dependencies** on every run. Resolution is non-deterministic across CI runs until lock files are committed.

**Action:** CI now uploads `pubspec.lock` artifacts per matrix job; commit locks to close N-002.

### F-002 — Analyzer info: deprecated `RadioListTile.onChanged` (mobile/android)

```
info • 'onChanged' is deprecated … mobile_remote_node_picker.dart:149, :161
```

Flutter 3.41+ expects `RadioGroup` wrapper. Desktop unaffected (no picker).

**Action:** Migrated to `RadioGroup<String>` in mobile + android pickers.

### F-003 — Residual debug env reads (N-004 carry-over)

CI static review found unguarded env usage:

- `ARQMA_FLUTTER_NO_SOLO_POOL` (desktop bridge)
- `ARQMA_FLUTTER_WALLET_RPC_MODE=subprocess` (mobile/android RPC session)

**Action:** Routed through `flutter_env_guard`.

### F-004 — iOS background / foreground sync overlap (N-006)

Background pulse timer and foreground recovery could interleave on iOS (`pulseBackgroundWalletSync` vs `recoverWalletSessionAfterForeground`).

**Action:** Added `_walletSyncLane` serializing pulse, persist, and recover on mobile/android bridges.

### F-005 — Dependabot (N-009, unchanged)

Default branch: **23 alerts** (4 high, 17 medium, 3 low). Not introduced by `review`; triage separately.

### F-006 — Node.js 20 deprecation notice

GitHub Actions warns `actions/checkout@v4` on Node 20 until Sept 2026. Informational only.
